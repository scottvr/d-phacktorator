# d-phacktorator
The D-Phacktorator - the dataset p-hacking fact-creator and phony correlation generator

# quick explanation of current files
(just in case someone stumbles upon this before I write good docs and such.)

The tool is ```phackt.py```. the dphack.py file is cruft but contains some  data munging code necessary for the sets I use in a demo plot. You'll want to run ```phackt.py``` (eventually)

When ready for prime time I will document clearly and will have taken whatever benefit the dphack.py script might be providing and moved it into the documentation, ensuring all functionality exists in the ```phackt.py``` tool, at which time I will delete the dphack script.
